# stuffbase-backend

This is the backend code for a basic app I'm building called StuffBase (name subject to change).

StuffBase is an organization app, which keeps track of your stuff, storage boxes, and storage locations. I'm building this project primarily 
to strengthen my skills as a backend developer and to learn React Native, which is what I plan to use for building the front end. This being a learning exercise,
it is unlikely that I'll be accepting foreign pull requests for now, but I do welcome any notes or feedback!
